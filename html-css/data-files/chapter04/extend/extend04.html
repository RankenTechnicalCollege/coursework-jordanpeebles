                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp" target="_blank">

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>
                    Hexadecimal codes use a base-16 format (e.g., #ff9900) and are compact, commonly used in web design. RGB codes specify color by mixing red, green, and blue light values (e.g., rgb(255, 153, 0)), making it easy to adjust individual color channels. HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness (e.g., hsl(36, 100%, 50%)), allowing for more intuitive color adjustments based on color properties. All three formats represent the same colors but offer different ways to define and modify them.
                </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: HSL, because it allows for easy adjustments to hue, saturation, and lightness, making it more intuitive to create and modify colors compared to hexadecimal or RGB.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>
                    HWB stands for Hue, Whiteness, and Blackness. It is a CSS color model that defines colors by their hue angle, and then mixes in white and black to adjust the tint and shade. HWB is considered more intuitive for humans because it allows you to describe colors in terms of how much white or black is added to a base hue.
                </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>
                    CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black). It is a color model used in color printing, where colors are created by combining different percentages of these four inks. Unlike RGB, which is used for digital screens, CMYK is subtractive and is best suited for printed materials.
