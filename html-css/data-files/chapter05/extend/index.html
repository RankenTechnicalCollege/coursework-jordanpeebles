            <div class="box sticky">
                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>The sticky position keeps the element in view as you scroll, until its parent container is out of view.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="box relative">
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>top: 40px; left: 80px; — The box moved 40px down and 80px right from its normal position.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>top: 30px; right: 50px; — The box is always 30px from the top and 50px from the right of the viewport, even when scrolling.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>bottom: 40px; right: 60px; — The box is positioned 40px from the bottom and 60px from the right of its closest positioned ancestor.</p>
